# Session Handoff - Phase 6 Ready

**Date**: October 24, 2025  
**Context Completion**: 96%  
**Status**: ✅ Ready for new session

---

## Quick Start for New Session

### 1. Read These Files First (In Order)
1. **`PHASE_6_PROTOTYPE_SUMMARY.md`** ⭐ START HERE
   - Complete implementation details
   - Code patterns and examples
   - Step-by-step guide

2. **`PHASE_6_DESIGN.md`**
   - Full architecture (536 lines)
   - Risk analysis
   - Testing strategy

3. **`PROJECT_STATUS.md`**
   - Overall project state
   - What's been delivered

### 2. Validate Current State
```bash
cd /home/jkh/Src/kit-app-template

# Check git status
git status
# Should show: On branch main, clean working directory

# Check recent commits
git log --oneline -5

# Verify tests pass
make test-compatibility
```

### 3. Begin Implementation
Start with **Phase 6.1: Foundation** as detailed in PHASE_6_PROTOTYPE_SUMMARY.md

---

## Project Status

### Completed (83%)
- ✅ Phase 1: Compatibility Testing (29 tests)
- ✅ Phase 2: CLI Enhancement (26 tests)  
- ✅ Phase 3: API Foundation (20 tests)
- ✅ Phase 3b: API Enhancements (24 tests)
- ✅ Phase 4: Backend Ready for UI
- ✅ Phase 5: Standalone Projects (4 tests)

**Total**: 103 tests, 99%+ passing, 17 hours invested

### Remaining (17%)
- ⏳ Phase 6: Per-App Dependencies (5-6 hours)
  - ✅ Design complete
  - ✅ Approach validated
  - ⏸️ Implementation pending

---

## Critical Context

### The Problem
Apps with custom `.kit` files break global cache. Need isolated Kit SDK per app.

### The Solution
Each app gets `source/apps/my.app/_kit/` with its own Kit SDK.

### The Approach
Extension-based (no packman core changes). Use existing packman capabilities.

### Backward Compatibility
Apps without `dependencies/` directory continue using global SDK.

## Key Files to Modify

1. **`tools/repoman/app_dependencies.py`** (NEW - create this)
2. **`tools/repoman/repoman.py`** (modify)
3. **`tools/repoman/template_engine.py`** (modify)
4. **`tools/repoman/launch.py`** (modify)
5. **`tests/per_app_deps/`** (NEW - create tests)

---

## Git Status
- Branch: `main`
- Commits ahead: 19
- Working directory: Clean
- Tests: Passing
- Ready: Yes

## For the AI Assistant

**Prompt for new session**:
```
I'm continuing Phase 6 implementation for kit-app-template. 
Please read PHASE_6_PROTOTYPE_SUMMARY.md and SESSION_HANDOFF.md 
to understand the current state, then begin Phase 6.1: Foundation 
as outlined in the prototype summary.

The goal is to enable per-app Kit SDK dependencies without 
modifying packman core. Design is complete, approach validated, 
ready for implementation.
```

---

## Success Criteria

✅ Apps can specify their own Kit SDK version  
✅ Configuration isolation between apps  
✅ Backward compatible (existing apps unchanged)  
✅ All 103 tests still pass  
✅ New tests for per-app dependencies pass  
✅ Documentation complete

---

**Session State**: Fully captured ✅  
**Ready for**: Phase 6 implementation  
**Estimated Time**: 5-6 hours  
**Next Step**: Create `tools/repoman/app_dependencies.py`
