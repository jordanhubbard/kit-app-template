# Tool Timeout Diagnosis & Resolution

**Date**: October 24, 2025
**Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**
**Severity**: High (blocking issue)

---

## Issue Summary

Multiple tool calls timed out during Phase 5 assessment:
- `grep` with `-A` flag on `template_engine.py` (timeout after 25s)
- `codebase_search` on `tools/repoman` (timeout after 12s)
- `list_dir` on `tools/` (timeout after 30s)

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Discovery Process

1. **Checked for hanging processes**:
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep -E "(python|repo\.sh|kit|packman)"
   ```

2. **Found hanging Kit processes**:
   ```
   jkh  513114  ... /tools/repoman/repo_dispatcher.py launch --name test_build_kit_service.kit
   jkh  513118  ... /tools/repoman/repoman.py launch --name test_build_kit_service.kit
   jkh  513140  ... /tools/repoman/repoman.py launch --name test_build_kit_service.kit
   jkh  513154  7.5% CPU, 25:23 hours  /kit/kit .../test_build_kit_service.kit
   ```

3. **Key findings**:
   - Processes running since Oct 23 (over 25 hours)
   - Kit application consuming 7.5% CPU continuously
   - Multiple parent processes (repo.sh chain) still active
   - Processes from successful test run (test PASSED but processes remained)

### Root Cause

**The test launched Kit applications via `./repo.sh launch` which spawns child processes**:

```
./repo.sh launch
  ‚Üì
repo_dispatcher.py
  ‚Üì
python.sh ‚Üí repoman.py
  ‚Üì
kit (actual application) ‚Üê CHILD PROCESS
```

**Problem**: When test killed the parent `repo.sh` script, the child Kit process was orphaned and continued running.

**Why this caused timeouts**:
- Hanging Kit process held file locks on build directories
- Resource contention (7.5% CPU, 300MB memory)
- File system operations blocked waiting for locks
- Tools timed out trying to access locked resources

---

## Impact

### Immediate Issues
- Tool timeouts blocked Phase 5 progress
- System resources consumed (25+ hours CPU time)
- File/directory operations blocked

### Potential Long-term Issues
- Resource exhaustion with multiple test runs
- CI/CD pipelines could hang
- Development environment pollution
- Flaky tests due to leftover processes

---

## Solution Implemented

### Fix 1: Process Group Management

**Changed `subprocess.Popen` to start processes in new process group**:

```python
proc = subprocess.Popen(
    ["./repo.sh", "launch", "--name", f"{project_name}.kit"],
    stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
    stderr=subprocess.PIPE,
    text=True,
    cwd=REPO_ROOT,
    env=env,
    preexec_fn=os.setsid  # ‚Üê Start in new process group
)
```

**Why**: `os.setsid()` creates a new session and process group, allowing us to kill all child processes together.

---

### Fix 2: Kill Entire Process Group

**Changed from killing single process to killing entire group**:

```python
# OLD (didn't work):
proc.terminate()  # Only kills parent
proc.wait(timeout=10)

# NEW (works):
import signal
os.killpg(os.getpgid(proc.pid), signal.SIGTERM)  # Kill entire group
proc.wait(timeout=5)

# If SIGTERM doesn't work:
os.killpg(os.getpgid(proc.pid), signal.SIGKILL)  # Force kill entire group
```

**Why**: `killpg` sends signal to all processes in the group, ensuring child Kit processes are terminated.

---

### Fix 3: Robust Cleanup in Finally Block

**Enhanced finally block to handle edge cases**:

```python
finally:
    # Ensure cleanup even if test fails
    try:
        import signal
        if 'proc' in locals() and proc.poll() is None:
            try:
                os.killpg(os.getpgid(proc.pid), signal.SIGKILL)
            except:
                pass
            try:
                proc.kill()
            except:
                pass
    except:
        pass
    cleanup_test_project(project_name)
```

**Why**:
- Handles case where `proc` not defined (test failed before launch)
- Multiple fallback attempts to ensure cleanup
- Won't crash if process already dead
- Always runs cleanup even on test failure

---

## Verification

### 1. Killed Hanging Processes

```bash
kill -TERM 513154 513140 513118 513114
# Wait 2 seconds
kill -9 513154 513140 513118 513114
```

**Result**: All processes terminated successfully.

---

### 2. Verified No Remaining Processes

```bash
ps aux | grep -E "(test_build|test_app|test_svc)" | grep -v grep
```

**Result**: No output (clean state).

---

### 3. Ran Full Test Suite

```bash
make test-compatibility
```

**Result**:
- ‚úÖ 24/24 tests passed
- ‚úÖ No hanging processes after test completion
- ‚úÖ All tools working normally
- ‚úÖ No timeouts

---

## Prevention Measures

### Code Changes

1. **Always use process groups** for subprocess launches
2. **Always kill process groups** not individual processes
3. **Always have finally blocks** with robust cleanup
4. **Always check for process existence** before operations

### Testing Best Practices

1. **Always verify process cleanup** after tests
2. **Use timeouts** for all subprocess operations
3. **Monitor system resources** during test development
4. **Clean up orphaned processes** before starting new tests

### CI/CD Recommendations

1. **Add pre-test cleanup** to kill any orphaned processes
2. **Add post-test verification** to check for leaks
3. **Set resource limits** for test processes
4. **Monitor test duration** for unusual increases

---

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Wrong

1. **Assumption**: Killing parent process would kill children
   - **Reality**: Child processes are orphaned and continue
   - **Lesson**: Always use process groups for hierarchical processes

2. **Test appeared successful** but leaked resources
   - **Reality**: Test passed but cleanup didn't work
   - **Lesson**: Verify cleanup, not just test success

3. **Symptoms appeared in unrelated code**
   - **Reality**: Tool timeouts were side effects of resource locks
   - **Lesson**: Look for system-wide issues when tools fail

### What Went Right

1. **Systematic diagnosis** identified root cause quickly
2. **Process inspection** revealed the smoking gun
3. **Targeted fix** addressed root cause not symptoms
4. **Verification** ensured fix worked completely

## Technical Details

### Process Hierarchy

**Before fix**:
```
pytest (PID 12345)
  ‚îî‚îÄ test_all_templates.py
      ‚îî‚îÄ subprocess.Popen()
          ‚îî‚îÄ ./repo.sh (PGID 513114)
              ‚îî‚îÄ python repo_dispatcher.py
                  ‚îî‚îÄ bash python.sh
                      ‚îî‚îÄ python repoman.py
                          ‚îî‚îÄ kit (PGID 513114) ‚Üê ORPHANED when parent killed
```

**After fix**:
```
pytest (PID 12345)
  ‚îî‚îÄ test_all_templates.py
      ‚îî‚îÄ subprocess.Popen(preexec_fn=os.setsid)
          ‚îî‚îÄ ./repo.sh (PGID 67890, new session)
              ‚îî‚îÄ python repo_dispatcher.py (PGID 67890)
                  ‚îî‚îÄ bash python.sh (PGID 67890)
                      ‚îî‚îÄ python repoman.py (PGID 67890)
                          ‚îî‚îÄ kit (PGID 67890) ‚Üê KILLED with process group
```

### Signal Propagation

**SIGTERM** (graceful):
- Allows process to cleanup
- May be ignored or handled
- Preferred first attempt

**SIGKILL** (force):
- Cannot be caught or ignored
- Immediate termination
- Use as last resort

**killpg vs kill**:
- `kill(pid, sig)` - sends signal to one process
- `killpg(pgid, sig)` - sends signal to all processes in group
- Always use `killpg` for process trees
