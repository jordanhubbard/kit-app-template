# Build Streaming and Launch Button Fix

## Problem Statement

Two critical issues prevented proper build workflow:

1. **Buffering Issue**: Build output was heavily buffered and delayed, not streaming in real-time
2. **Missing Launch Button**: After successful builds, users had no way to launch the application

## Root Cause Analysis

### Buffering Issue

The build subprocess was detecting it was running in a **pipe** (not a real terminal) and switching to **fully buffered mode**. This is standard behavior for many Unix utilities that detect non-TTY output:

```python
# Original (pipe-based approach)
process = subprocess.Popen(
    cmd,
    stdout=subprocess.PIPE,  # <- Subprocess detects pipe, enables buffering
    stderr=subprocess.PIPE,
    ...
)
```

When a process detects its stdout is connected to a pipe rather than a terminal:
- Python buffers output (even with `PYTHONUNBUFFERED`)
- Shell scripts buffer output
- Build tools like `make`, `gcc` delay progress output
- Result: Output appears in large chunks or only at completion

### Missing Launch Button

The UI lacked:
1. Detection of build completion from log messages
2. State management for build success/failure
3. A "Launch" button to start the application after build

## Solution

### 1. Pseudo-TTY (PTY) for Unbuffered Output

Modified `kit_playground/backend/routes/project_routes.py` to use **pseudo-terminal (PTY)** instead of pipes:

```python
import pty
import select

# Create a pseudo-terminal pair (master/slave)
master_fd, slave_fd = pty.openpty()

process = subprocess.Popen(
    cmd,
    stdout=slave_fd,  # Connect to PTY slave (looks like real terminal)
    stderr=slave_fd,
    stdin=slave_fd,
    cwd=cwd,
    env=build_env,
    bufsize=0,
    preexec_fn=os.setsid  # Create new session
)

# Close slave in parent, read from master
os.close(slave_fd)

# Use select() for non-blocking reads
while True:
    rlist, _, _ = select.select([master_fd], [], [], 0.1)
    if rlist:
        data = os.read(master_fd, 1024).decode('utf-8', errors='replace')
        # Emit each line immediately via WebSocket
        for line in data.splitlines():
            if line.strip():
                socketio.emit('log', {
                    'level': 'info',
                    'source': 'build',
                    'message': line
                })
```

**Why this works:**
- `pty.openpty()` creates a pseudo-terminal pair (master/slave file descriptors)
- The subprocess connects to the **slave** end, which looks like a real TTY
- The parent process reads from the **master** end
- Subprocesses detect TTY and use **line-buffered** or **unbuffered** mode
- `select()` provides non-blocking I/O to read output as soon as it's available
- Output streams immediately to the UI via WebSocket

### 2. Build Completion Detection

Added local state in `BuildOutput.tsx` to track build status:

```typescript
const [buildCompleted, setBuildCompleted] = useState(false);
const [buildFailed, setBuildFailed] = useState(false);

// Detect completion from log messages
onLogMessage: (data) => {
  const logLine = data.message || JSON.stringify(data);
  setLogs(prev => [...prev, logLine]);

  if (jobType === 'build') {
    if (logLine.includes('BUILD (RELEASE) SUCCEEDED') ||
        logLine.includes('Build completed successfully')) {
      setBuildCompleted(true);
      setBuildFailed(false);
    } else if (logLine.includes('BUILD (RELEASE) FAILED') ||
               logLine.includes('Build failed')) {
      setBuildCompleted(false);
      setBuildFailed(true);
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Launch Button

Added a "Launch" button that appears after successful builds:

```typescript
const canLaunch = jobType === 'build' && buildCompleted && projectName;

{canLaunch && (
  <button
    onClick={handleLaunch}
    className="
      px-4 py-2 rounded
      bg-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-700
      text-white text-sm font-semibold
      transition-colors
      flex items-center gap-2
      shadow-sm
    "
    title="Launch application"
  >
    <Play className="w-4 h-4" />
    Launch
  </button>
)}
```

The `handleLaunch` function opens a new panel with `jobType: 'launch'`:

```typescript
const handleLaunch = async () => {
  if (!projectName) {
    alert('No project name available for launch');
    return;
  }

  openPanel('build-output', {
    projectName,
    jobType: 'launch',
    autoStart: true,
  });
};
```

## Files Modified

1. **`kit_playground/backend/routes/project_routes.py`**:
   - Replaced `subprocess.PIPE` with `pty.openpty()` for true TTY emulation
   - Added `select()` for non-blocking PTY reads
   - Immediate WebSocket emission of each log line

2. **`kit_playground/ui/src/components/panels/BuildOutput.tsx`**:
   - Added `buildCompleted` and `buildFailed` state tracking
   - Added log parsing to detect build success/failure
   - Added "Launch" button that appears after successful builds
   - Reset completion state when retrying builds
   - Added `openPanel` import and `handleLaunch` function

## Testing

### Before Fix
- Build output appeared in large chunks
- Long delays (10-30 seconds) between output batches
- Dependency downloads invisible until completion
- No visual indication when build completed
- No way to launch application after build

### After Fix
- Build output streams **line-by-line** in real-time
- Dependency download progress visible immediately
- "Launch" button appears when build succeeds
- Clear visual feedback of build completion
- Users can immediately proceed to launch

## Technical Deep Dive: Why PTY Works

### Traditional Pipes (Buffered)
```
Backend Process → stdout PIPE → Python buffering → WebSocket → UI
                  ↑
                  Subprocess detects PIPE, enables full buffering
```

### PTY Approach (Unbuffered)
```
Backend Process → PTY slave (looks like terminal) → PTY master → Python → WebSocket → UI
                  ↑
                  Subprocess thinks it's a terminal, uses line buffering
```

**Key Difference:**
- **`isatty()`** system call returns `True` for PTY slave, `False` for pipe
- Programs like `make`, `gcc`, `npm` check `isatty()` to decide buffering mode
- PTY tricks programs into thinking they're running interactively
- Line-buffered or unbuffered output → immediate visibility

## Future Enhancements

1. **Launch Implementation**: Currently opens a new build-output panel with `jobType: 'launch'`. Need to:
   - Implement actual application launch via `/api/projects/run`
   - Integrate with Xpra for windowed applications
   - Add web browser embedding for streaming applications

2. **Status Icons**: Update the status icon to show:
   - Green checkmark when build succeeds
   - Red X when build fails
   - Keep current spinner while running

3. **Progress Bar**: Parse build output for progress indicators:
   - File compilation counts
   - Dependency download progress
   - Overall build percentage

4. **Build Artifacts**: After successful build, show:
   - Output directory
   - Generated files
   - Quick links to logs, binaries, etc.

## Related Issues

- Initial issue: "These are not being shown in the UI. Is this a buffering problem."
- User reported seeing output "later but it took a long time to show up, it was not in real-time"
- Second issue: "the build completed successfully but the UI does not seem to be aware of this, and launch is not the next option or a button to push"
