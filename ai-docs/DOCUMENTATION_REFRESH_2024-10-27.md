---

## Technical Writing Principles Applied

### 1. Progressive Disclosure

Start simple, build complexity:
- Example 1: Just create an app
- Example 2: Build it
- Example 3: Launch it
- Example 4: Edit configuration
- Example 5: Add extensions
- Example 6: Advanced (standalone projects)

### 2. Dual Format

Every workflow shown two ways:
```
### Using Kit Playground (UI)
1. Click...
2. Watch...
3. Done!

### Using Command Line (CLI)
```bash
./repo.sh command
```
```

### 3. Concrete Examples

Not: "You can create an application"
But: "Let's create a simple 3D editor called `my_editor`"

### 4. Scannable Structure

- Clear hierarchical headings
- Bullet points for steps
- Tables for reference data
- Code blocks for examples
- Visual separation (---) between sections

### 5. Active Voice

Not: "The build button should be clicked"
But: "Click the Build button"

### 6. Direct Address

Speak to "you":
- "Your application is created at..."
- "You'll see output streaming..."
- "Click the button to..."
