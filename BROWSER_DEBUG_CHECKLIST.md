# Browser Debugging Checklist 🔍

## ✅ CONFIRMED: Server is Serving Correct Code

The `/src/main.tsx` file served by Vite DOES contain:
```javascript
console.log("🎨 Kit Playground UI Loading...");
console.log("📦 Version:", UI_VERSION);
console.log("🔧 Mode:", import.meta.env.MODE);
console.log("🌐 Base URL:", import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL);
```

**This means the problem is in the BROWSER, not the server!**

---

## 🌐 Step-by-Step Browser Diagnosis

### 1. Check Console Filter Settings

Open DevTools (F12) → Console tab:

1. Look for a **filter dropdown** (usually top-right of console)
2. Make sure **"All levels"** or **"Verbose"** is selected
3. Uncheck any filters like "Hide network messages"
4. Look for **"Default levels"** button and make sure "Info" is checked

**Common issue**: Console is filtered to only show "Errors" or "Warnings"

---

### 2. Check for JavaScript Errors

In Console tab:

1. Look for any **RED error messages**
2. Check for "Failed to load module" errors
3. Look for CORS errors
4. Check the **Network tab** → Filter by "JS" → Look for failed requests (red)

**If you see errors, report them!**

---

### 3. Check Network Tab

1. Open DevTools → **Network tab**
2. **Hard refresh** the page (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
3. Look for these requests:
   - `main.tsx` - Should be **200 OK**
   - `App.tsx` - Should be **200 OK**
   - `@vite/client` - Should be **200 OK**

**If any are failing (red), report the status code!**

---

### 4. Check Browser Extensions

1. Open an **Incognito/Private window** (Ctrl+Shift+N)
2. Extensions are usually disabled in incognito
3. Go to http://10.176.222.115:3000
4. Open console and check again

**If it works in incognito → an extension is blocking it!**

---

### 5. Hard Refresh & Cache Clear

In the browser, with DevTools open:

1. **Right-click** the refresh button (next to URL bar)
2. Select **"Empty Cache and Hard Reload"**
3. **OR**: DevTools → Application tab → Clear storage → Clear site data

This clears ALL browser caches (different from clearing .vite/ on server)

---

### 6. Check JavaScript is Enabled

In Chrome:
1. Settings → Privacy and security → Site settings → JavaScript
2. Should be "Sites can use JavaScript"

In Firefox:
1. Type `about:config` in address bar
2. Search for `javascript.enabled`
3. Should be `true`

---

### 7. Check Content Security Policy

In Console, look for errors like:
```
Refused to execute inline script because it violates the following
Content Security Policy directive...
```

**If you see this, report it!**

---

### 8. Try a Different Browser

If using Chrome, try Firefox (or vice versa).

If it works in a different browser → browser-specific issue!

---

## 📊 Quick Test: Direct JavaScript Access

Open the browser console and type:

```javascript
fetch('http://10.176.222.115:3000/src/main.tsx').then(r=>r.text()).then(t=>console.log(t.includes('Kit Playground UI Loading')))
```

**Expected result**: `true`

If this returns `false` or errors → network/CORS issue!

---

## 🚨 Most Likely Causes (in order)

1. **Console filter is hiding log messages** ← CHECK THIS FIRST!
2. **JavaScript error preventing execution** ← Check for red errors
3. **CORS or module loading failure** ← Check Network tab
4. **Browser extension blocking** ← Try incognito
5. **Service worker or cache** ← Hard refresh + clear cache

---

## 📝 What to Report Back

Please check these and report:

1. **Console Filter Settings**: What level is selected? (All/Info/Warn/Error)
2. **Any Red Errors**: Copy/paste any error messages
3. **Network Tab**: Are `main.tsx` and `App.tsx` loading? (Status codes?)
4. **Incognito Mode**: Does it work in incognito?
5. **Browser**: Which browser and version? (Chrome 120? Firefox 110?)
6. **Direct JavaScript Test**: Does the `fetch()` test above return `true`?

This will tell us EXACTLY what's blocking the JavaScript! 🎯
