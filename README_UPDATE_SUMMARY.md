### 2. 📁 Enhanced Directory Documentation

**New: "Directories Created by Templates" Section**

Shows exactly what gets created for:
- **Applications** - Complete directory tree with file explanations
- **Extensions** - Python extension structure breakdown
- **Build Artifacts** - What the build system generates

**Key Information:**
```
source/apps/my_company.my_app/
├── my_company.my_app.kit    # Main configuration
├── README.md                 # Documentation
├── .project-meta.toml       # Project metadata
├── repo.sh / repo.bat       # Wrapper scripts
```

**Benefits:**
- Users know exactly what to expect
- Clear understanding of file organization
- No surprises during development

### 3. 📦 Template Type Documentation

**New: Complete Template Tables**

#### Application Templates
| Template | Command | Use Case |
|----------|---------|----------|
| Kit Base Editor | `template new kit_base_editor` | Minimal OpenUSD editor |
| USD Viewer | `template new omni_usd_viewer` | Viewport-only streaming |
| USD Explorer | `template new omni_usd_explorer` | Large scene exploration |
| USD Composer | `template new omni_usd_composer` | Complex scene authoring |

#### Extension Templates
- Python Extension
- Python UI Extension
- C++ Extension

Each template includes:
- Command to create it
- Use case description
- Complete working example

### 4. 🎨 Kit Playground Documentation

**Enhanced GUI Instructions:**
- How to launch (`make playground`)
- Features breakdown (gallery, editor, preview, build)
- Side-by-side development workflow
- Device testing modes (Desktop, Tablet, Phone, 4K)
- Visual connection system
- Build and deployment options

**User Benefits:**

### 5. 💡 Common Workflows Section

**Real-World Examples:**

**Multiple Applications:**
```bash
./repo.sh template new kit_base_editor --name my_company.app_one
./repo.sh template new omni_usd_viewer --name my_company.app_two
./repo.sh build
./repo.sh launch --name my_company.app_one
```

**Adding Extensions:**
```bash
./repo.sh template new basic_python_ui_extension --name my_company.my_tool
./repo.sh build
./repo.sh launch
```

**Standalone Projects:**
```bash
./repo.sh template new kit_base_editor \
  --output-dir ~/my-projects/standalone-app
cd ~/my-projects/standalone-app
./repo.sh build
```

### 6. 🔧 "Detailed CLI Workflow" Section

**What Changed:**
- Old "Quick Start" renamed to "Detailed CLI Workflow"

- Enhanced with advanced usage patterns
- Added automation examples
- Documented build configurations

**New Content:**

- Platform-specific build directories explained
- Each directory now has clear purpose

### 8. 🆘 Troubleshooting Section
