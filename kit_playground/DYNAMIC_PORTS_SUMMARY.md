# Dynamic Port Allocation - Implementation Summary

## Problem Solved

The Kit Playground previously used hardcoded ports (8200 for backend, 3000 for frontend), which caused failures when:
- Ports were already in use by other services
- Multiple playground instances needed to run simultaneously
- Running on shared/controlled host environments

## Solution

Implemented automatic port discovery and allocation that:
1. Finds available ports at startup
2. Dynamically configures both backend and frontend to use those ports
3. Reports the allocated ports to the user
4. Works reliably on any host system

## Changes Made

### New Files

1. **`kit_playground/find_free_port.py`**
   - Python utility to find available network ports
   - Can find single or multiple consecutive free ports
   - Uses socket binding to test port availability
   - Made executable with `chmod +x`

### Modified Files

1. **`kit_playground/dev.sh`**
   - Added port finding logic at startup
   - Dynamic port allocation for backend and frontend
   - Generates `setupProxy.js` with correct backend port
   - Updated all port references to use variables
   - Added cleanup of generated proxy config on exit
   - Reports allocated ports in startup banner

2. **`kit_playground/ui/package.json`**
   - Removed static `"proxy": "http://localhost:8200"` configuration
   - Added `http-proxy-middleware: "^2.0.6"` dependency
   - Proxy now configured dynamically at runtime

3. **`.gitignore`**
   - Added `kit_playground/ui/src/setupProxy.js` (dynamically generated file)

### Files That Work Without Changes

1. **`kit_playground/playground.sh`**
   - Already delegates to `dev.sh`, inherits dynamic ports

2. **`kit_playground/backend/web_server.py`**
   - Already has port conflict handling (tries next port if busy)
   - Accepts `--port` argument from `dev.sh`

## How It Works

### Startup Sequence

```bash
make playground REMOTE=1
```

1. **Find Available Ports**
   ```bash
   python3 find_free_port.py 2 8000
   # Returns: "8000 8001"
   ```

2. **Start Backend**
   ```bash
   python3 web_server.py --port 8000 --host 0.0.0.0
   ```

3. **Generate Proxy Configuration**
   ```javascript
   // ui/src/setupProxy.js
   module.exports = function(app) {
     app.use('/api', createProxyMiddleware({
       target: 'http://localhost:8000',  // Dynamic!
       changeOrigin: true,
     }));
   };
   ```

4. **Start Frontend**
   ```bash
   PORT=8001 HOST=0.0.0.0 npm start
   ```

5. **Display URLs**
   ```
   ✓ Allocated ports: Backend=8000, Frontend=8001
   • Backend API:  http://0.0.0.0:8000
   • Frontend UI:  http://0.0.0.0:8001
   ```

## Testing Results

### Test 1: Clean Start
```bash
$ make playground REMOTE=1
Finding available ports...
✓ Allocated ports: Backend=8000, Frontend=8001
✓ Backend running (PID: 2388854)
✓ Development servers are running!
```

### Test 2: Port Verification
```bash
$ lsof -i :8000 -i :8001
python3 2388854 jkh  5u  IPv4  TCP *:8000 (LISTEN)
node    2388950 jkh 23u  IPv4  TCP *:8001 (LISTEN)
```

### Test 3: API Connectivity
```bash
$ curl http://localhost:8000/api/health
{"status":"ok","timestamp":"2025-10-05T22:52:40.485525"}

$ curl http://localhost:8000/api/v2/templates | jq 'length'
13  # All 13 templates loaded successfully
```

### Test 4: Frontend Access
```bash
$ curl -s http://localhost:8001 | head -3
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
```

## Benefits

### Reliability
- ✅ No more "port already in use" errors
- ✅ Works on any host system
- ✅ Handles port conflicts automatically

### Flexibility
- ✅ Multiple playground instances can run simultaneously
- ✅ No manual port configuration needed
- ✅ Adapts to any available port range

### User Experience
- ✅ Clear port allocation messages
- ✅ Automatic configuration
- ✅ No manual intervention required

### Development
- ✅ CI/CD friendly
- ✅ Docker/container compatible
- ✅ Shared development environments supported

## Documentation

Created comprehensive documentation:
- **`DYNAMIC_PORTS.md`** - Full technical documentation
- **`DYNAMIC_PORTS_SUMMARY.md`** (this file) - Implementation summary

## Backward Compatibility

- ✅ `make playground` still works
- ✅ `./playground.sh` still works
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved
- ✅ Only the port allocation mechanism changed

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. Store allocated ports in a temp file for easier inspection
2. Add port range configuration via environment variables
3. Port allocation for Xpra sessions
4. Health check endpoint that reports all allocated ports
5. Support for specifying preferred ports with automatic fallback

## Cleanup

The implementation includes proper cleanup:
- Generated `setupProxy.js` is removed on shutdown
- Processes are killed cleanly with trap handlers
- No leftover files or processes
