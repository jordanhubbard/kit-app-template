# PLAN.md Summary - Quick Reference

## What Was Done

Analyzed the kit-app-template project and created a comprehensive, methodical plan (`PLAN.md`) to implement all features described in `PLAN.txt` while preserving backward compatibility.

## Key Problems Identified

1. **No Compatibility Tests**: Changes were made without baseline tests to catch regressions
2. **Interactive Mode Broken**: CLI changes may have broken interactive workflows
3. **No Test-First Approach**: Features were "vibe-coded" before tests were written
4. **API-CLI Divergence**: No systematic API wrapper for CLI operations
5. **Missing Non-Interactive Support**: Automation and CI/CD pipelines need non-interactive flags

## Solution: 6-Phase Layer-by-Layer Approach

### Phase 1: Foundation - Compatibility Testing (Weeks 1-2) ⭐ START HERE
**Goal**: Establish baseline tests BEFORE making any changes

**Deliverables**:
- Compatibility test suite for all CLI commands
- Template generation tests for all documented templates
- Build/launch tests with --no-window
- Baseline results documenting current state

**Why This Matters**: These tests protect against regressions and validate that "existing CLI behavior" is preserved.

### Phase 2: CLI Enhancement - Non-Interactive Support (Weeks 3-4)
**Goal**: Add automation flags WITHOUT breaking interactive mode

**New Features**:
- `--accept-license` flag for automation
- `--batch-mode` flag for CI/CD
- `--json` output mode for scripting
- `--verbose` and `--quiet` modes

**Principle**: All changes are ADDITIVE. Existing commands work exactly as before.

### Phase 3: API Layer - REST API Wrapper (Weeks 5-7)
**Goal**: Expose all CLI functionality via REST API

**Features**:
- REST endpoints for all CLI operations
- Job management for long-running builds
- WebSocket streaming for real-time logs
- CLI-API equivalence tests

### Phase 4: Web UI Enhancement - Kit Playground (Weeks 8-10)
**Goal**: Validate and enhance the existing Kit Playground UI

**Features**:
- Template gallery validation
- Project creation wizard
- Build integration with real-time logs
- Launch integration with Xpra

### Phase 5: Standalone Projects (Weeks 11-12)
**Goal**: Enable self-contained projects that build independently

**Feature**:
```bash
./repo.sh template new kit_base_editor \
  --name my.app \
  --output-dir ~/standalone \
  --standalone
```

### Phase 6: Per-App Kit Dependencies (Weeks 13-15)
**Goal**: Store Kit SDK per-application instead of globally

**Benefit**: Apps can use different Kit SDK versions without conflict.

## Critical Success Factors

### ✅ DO:
- Write tests FIRST, then implement features
- Preserve backward compatibility (all existing docs/examples work)
- Add new flags, don't modify existing behavior
- Run full test suite at end of each phase
- Document as you go

### ❌ DON'T:
- Make changes without tests to validate them
- Break existing interactive mode
- Skip phases or validation checkpoints
- Assume existing code works (test it!)

## Testing Strategy

```
Quick Tests (< 3 min):        make test-quick
Compatibility Tests:          make test-compatibility
Integration Tests:            make test-integration
Full Test Suite:              make test-all
```

**Test Pyramid**:
- Unit tests: < 1 minute (fast feedback)
- Compatibility tests: ~2 minutes (regression detection)
- Integration tests: ~10 minutes (feature validation)
- E2E tests: ~1 hour (full system validation)

## Audit Checklist (End of Each Phase)

- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Backward compatibility verified
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Performance validated (no significant slowdown)
- [ ] Security validated (run security tests)

## How to Get Started

### Step 1: Review the Full Plan
```bash
cd /home/jkh/Src/kit-app-template
less PLAN.md
```

### Step 2: Create Phase 1 Tests (Compatibility Testing)
```bash
mkdir -p tests/compatibility
cd tests/compatibility

# Create test files:
touch test_cli_workflows.py
touch test_template_generation.py
touch test_template_builds.py
```

### Step 3: Write Baseline Tests
Start with `test_cli_workflows.py`:
```python
import subprocess
import pytest

class TestCLICompatibility:
    def test_template_list_works(self):
        """Verify ./repo.sh template list returns without error"""
        result = subprocess.run(
            ["./repo.sh", "template", "list"],
            capture_output=True,
            text=True,
            cwd="/home/jkh/Src/kit-app-template"
        )
        assert result.returncode == 0
        assert "kit_base_editor" in result.stdout
```

### Step 4: Run Tests and Document Baseline
```bash
cd /home/jkh/Src/kit-app-template
pytest tests/compatibility/ -v > baseline_test_results.txt
```

### Step 5: Only After Phase 1 Complete, Move to Phase 2
Don't skip ahead! The foundation is critical.

## Quick Reference: What Each Phase Delivers

| Phase | Outcome | Can Skip? |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| 1: Compatibility Tests | Safety net for all future work | ❌ NO - Required foundation |
| 2: CLI Non-Interactive | Automation support (CI/CD) | ❌ NO - Critical requirement |
| 3: REST API | Remote execution capability | ⚠️ Maybe - If no remote execution needed |
| 4: Web UI Enhancement | Visual development experience | ⚠️ Maybe - CLI-only shops could skip |
| 5: Standalone Projects | Portable, distributable apps | ⚠️ Maybe - If all work in repo |
| 6: Per-App Dependencies | Multiple Kit SDK versions | ✅ YES - Nice-to-have |

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Pitfall 1: Skipping Compatibility Tests
**Problem**: Make changes, discover regressions too late
**Solution**: Write tests FIRST, establish baseline

### Pitfall 2: Breaking Interactive Mode
**Problem**: Add non-interactive flags but break prompts
**Solution**: Test both modes after every change

### Pitfall 3: Not Testing Build/Launch
**Problem**: Templates create but don't build
**Solution**: Test full workflow (create → build → launch --no-window)

### Pitfall 4: API Diverges from CLI
**Problem**: API and CLI produce different results
**Solution**: CLI-API equivalence tests (Phase 3)

### Pitfall 5: No Rollback Plan
**Problem**: Phase fails, can't revert cleanly
**Solution**: Use feature branches, merge only after validation

## Questions & Answers

### Q: Can I skip Phase 1 and start implementing features?
**A**: No. Phase 1 creates the safety net that prevents regressions. Without it, you're coding blind.

### Q: What if Phase 1 tests reveal the current system is broken?
**A**: Good! That's why we test first. Document what's broken, fix it, then proceed.

### Q: How long will this take?
**A**: Full implementation: ~15 weeks. But you can stop after Phase 3 and have 80% of value (automation + API).

### Q: Can phases be parallelized?
**A**: No. Each phase builds on previous ones. Phase 2 needs Phase 1 tests. Phase 3 needs Phase 2 flags. Etc.

### Q: What if I don't need all 6 phases?
**A**: Phases 1-3 are essential. Phases 4-6 are optional based on your requirements. But don't skip the order.

## Next Steps

1. **Read**: Full PLAN.md file
2. **Understand**: The layer-by-layer approach
3. **Create**: Phase 1 test directory structure
4. **Write**: First compatibility test
5. **Establish**: Baseline test results
6. **Proceed**: To Phase 2 only after Phase 1 complete

## Success Criteria

You'll know this plan is working when:
- ✅ Every phase ends with all tests passing
- ✅ Existing CLI workflows never break
- ✅ Documentation stays accurate
- ✅ New features add value without complexity
- ✅ The system becomes more testable over time

**Remember**: The goal is not speed, it's quality and maintainability. Take time to do it right.

**Most Important Rule**: Test first, implement second, validate third. No exceptions.
